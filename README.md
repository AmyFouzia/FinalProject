## Tuesday, May 21, 2019

- prototype was fully approved, except I need to fix the UML
- character and obstacle shldnt extend bullet, make a parent class for all three
- experimented more with enemy movement
- multiple enemies spawn at the top with space in between and make their way towards the bottom
- started experimenting with making a timer for scoreTracker

- timer works, can make a scoreTracker(maybe implement a highscore?)
- enemy movement updated so that they keep respawning at semi-random speeds
