# Final Project

## Thursday, May 16, 2019

- experimentation with movement of the character
- character follows the mouse
- experimentation with enemy movement 
- one rectangle moves down the screen

## Tuesday, May 21, 2019

- prototype was fully approved, except I need to fix the UML
- character and obstacle shldnt extend bullet, make a parent class for all three
- experimented more with enemy movement
- multiple enemies spawn at the top with space in between and make their way towards the bottom
- started experimenting with making a timer for scoreTracker

## Wednesday, May 22, 2019

- timer works, can make a scoreTracker(maybe implement a highscore?)
- enemy movement updated so that they keep respawning at semi-random speeds

## Thursday, May 23, 2019

- Made the screen size bigger
- Mr.K said to make enemies autonomous and to add lives
- updated collision with code

## Friday, May 24, 2019

- added a separate enemy class to lessen code in collision exp
- made all the priv methods with accessors, figuring out the enemy movement

## Tuesday, May 28, 2019

- still transitioning into separate enemy class
- figuring out ways to update the x and y vals for enemies to simulate autonomous movement

## Wednesday, May 29, 2019

- had to go back on old code, a little stuck
- feeling like im onto something with enemy movement, def cant use for and while loops too much
